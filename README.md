# Project-1

Plan A. Whack a mole javascript query game. The user will have a hammer or some kind of weapon fixed to the mouse and when the mole…or maybe a different creature pops up you whack it….Whack a mole. Instead of moles popping up the holes will pop up with randomly generated ingredients to make guacamole. Onions, tomatoes, avocados and chili peppers..maybe. two players will take turns battling to see who can make the guacamole the fastest. There will be a timer, and there will be a counter for how many of each ingredient they hit. Whoever can feed the party(the counter will be the party getting hungrier) first WINS!!!

Ask reuben if I can play the song guacamole at the end for whoever wins. COPYRIGHT?

Plan B. Juggling game, you have to keep one ball in the air for a certain amount of time. Once that time has been reached another ball will pop up and so on. I’m not sure if with would require a physics engine but I think it would be a cool idea.

Plan C. Hammer game from carnival.

Plan D. Food recipe game when you have some kind of food displayed at the top of the screen and then below will be a list of a bunch of ingredients that either match or don’t match. Player who matches the most food wins the game.
